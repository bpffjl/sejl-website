    "text": "I love the vibe of Caffetto. It’s not sleek or pristine. From my view I can see walls painted red and gold, covered with paintings by local artists. Cabinets are stuffed with piles or board games. A creepy bust sits by the window next to a pink lamp and two figurines. The music is old-sounding Americana, which probably isn’t to old.\nUnfortunately, I’m pretty underwhelmed by the coffee. My cappuccino is harsh and tastes of charred wood. The drink was prepared by holding back the foam in the steaming pitcher and pouring the hot milk into the espresso. Then the foamy was scooped on top. That’s never been my favorite way to make a cappuccino, but I was open to seeing what it tasted like. The first sip was all sweet foam. When i tried again and got some coffee, it tasted bitter and thick.\n\n\n\nCappuccino at Caffetto\n\n\nI won’t go out of my way to come here again."

    "text": "I’m taking a week long staycation between jobs and trying out different coffee shops in the Twin Cities. Yesterday, I went to Caffetto.\nToday, I’ve gone the other direction into Saint Paul to check out Cafe Astoria. They’ve got an extensive cafe menu and these beautiful rainbow lattes. I was tempted by the rainbow lattes, but decided to go with my usual drink, a cortado. What I got is certainly the largest cortado, I’ve ever seen. More like a small latte than the equal parts espresso and steamed milk that I was expecting. That said, it was very tasty - smooth, sweet, and perfectly warm.\n\n\n\nCortado at Cafe Astoria\n\n\nIf I’m in this neighborhood, I’ll certainly keep this spot in mind for coffee or lunch."
