I've never been let down by any [Five Watt](https://fivewattcoffee.com/) shop. I love their specialty drinks. They don't make them overly sweet, but fun with just the kind of spices that I love. Put coriander in something and my antennae perk up.

Today, I came to the location in Kingfield neighborhood. This intersection has got a handful of great restaurants in addition to Five Watt. I went to the counter and the barista popped over instantly. I asked if they had any gibralter-sized specialty drinks. They didn't, but the barista said they'd make me something. "Want a pumpkin?" they said. Indeed I would. The drink was ready in just the time it took me to put my bag down and it was a perfect mini-pumpkin latte. Not too sweet and very yummy.
