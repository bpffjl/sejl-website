I'm taking a week long staycation between jobs and trying out different coffee shops in the Twin Cities. Yesterday, I went to [Caffetto](http://www.caffettocafe.com/).

Today, I've gone the other direction into Saint Paul to check out [Cafe Astoria](https://cafeastoria-stpaul.com/). They've got an extensive cafe menu and these beautiful rainbow lattes. I was tempted by the rainbow lattes, but decided to go with my usual drink, a cortado. What I got is certainly the *largest* cortado, I've ever seen. More like a small latte than the equal parts espresso and steamed milk that I was expecting. That said, it was very tasty - smooth, sweet, and perfectly warm.

If I'm in this neighborhood, I'll certainly keep this spot in mind for coffee or lunch.
