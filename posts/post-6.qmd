I'm in Washington for a couple of days in the office at my new job with the US Office of Personnel Management. We were given early release today. I walked through the mall and checked out the White House with other tourists. Clouds rolled in and it started to rain. I was generally heading toward [dua dc](https://duadc.com/) for a coffee, but the big rain drops made me pick up my steps.

This shop had a drink that I'd never heard of before: a piccolo. As it turns out a piccolo is a half-sized cortado, or a big macchiato. They served the drink in a small paper cup, which was kind of a bummer, but it was good. I prefer the slightly more milk I get in a cortado, but this was good. It was *strong*. The coffee was thick, smooth, and lingering.

The shop is sleek, long and narrow. It's both colorful and simple with lots or white and wood, but there's also a cool mural at the entry.
