<p>I’m in Washington for a couple of days in the office at my new job with the US Office of Personnel Management. We were given early release today. I walked through the mall and checked out the White House with other tourists. Clouds rolled in and it started to rain. I was generally heading toward <a href="https://duadc.com/">dua dc</a> for a coffee, but the big rain drops made me pick up my steps.</p>
<p>This shop had a drink that I’d never heard of before: a piccolo. As it turns out a piccolo is a half-sized cortado, or a big macchiato. They served the drink in a small paper cup, which was kind of a bummer, but it was good. I prefer the slightly more milk I get in a cortado, but this was good. It was <em>strong</em>. The coffee was thick, smooth, and lingering.</p>
<p>The shop is sleek, long and narrow. It’s both colorful and simple with lots or white and wood, but there’s also a cool mural at the entry.</p>

<p>On Sunday, I shard some thoughts about why giving to <a href="https://www.spucconsummit.org/">my church</a> is important to the work on the Ministry of Social Justice and Outreach on which I’m a new member. Here are my notes:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Hello everyone. I’m Ben Jaques-Leslie. I’m a member of the Ministry of Social Justice and Outreach. I’d like to share some about how your giving to the church supports the work of this ministry and why I think that’s important.<br>
<br>
For me, activism and working toward social justice came before church. The home I grew up in was full of academic books about religion, but anti-church-going. In high school, I started to be interested in social issues. I joined clubs, attended rallies, protested. And while it sometimes takes time to explain, my career choices have been motivated by the desire to pursue equity and increase freedom.<br>
<br>
What is most exciting to me about our work in the Ministry of Social Justice and Outreach is the understanding that social justice is not a single issue, but part of all that we do. Marginalization and oppression are not simple problems to be solved, because they are integrated into our society and psychology. That sounds pretty overwhelming, but I like to think of it this way. If oppressions is so knitted into our world, then we have many opportunities to struggle against it. In our language, in how we spend money, in how we vote, we have so many ways to pursue justice.<br>
<br>
And in the Ministry of Social Justice and Outreach, we are trying to connect through out the church to pursue justice in many different ways, leveraging capacities and interests of other ministries and members. Next year we plan to spend 13% of pledged giving on supporting community partners. These partners include Interfaith Action (which is also the Dept. of Indian Work, Project Home, and Opportunity Partners like a free legal clinic). Also partners including Habitat for Humanity, reparations work through Indian Land Tenure, Minnesota Interfaith power and light for environmental justice, and the wider work of Our Church's Wider Mission, which supports the UCC and their work on LGBTQ issues, Racial Justice, and Disaster Assistance.<br>
<br>
The work of our Ministry is broad, internal and outreaching, much like the challenges we see improving equity and fighting for social justice. Thank you for your giving.</p>
</blockquote>

  <title>Five Watt</title>

<p>I’ve never been let down by any <a href="https://fivewattcoffee.com/">Five Watt</a> shop. I love their specialty drinks. They don’t make them overly sweet, but fun with just the kind of spices that I love. Put coriander in something and my antennae perk up.</p>
<p>Today, I came to the location in Kingfield neighborhood. This intersection has got a handful of great restaurants in addition to Five Watt. I went to the counter and the barista popped over instantly. I asked if they had any gibralter-sized specialty drinks. They didn’t, but the barista said they’d make me something. “Want a pumpkin?” they said. Indeed I would. The drink was ready in just the time it took me to put my bag down and it was a perfect mini-pumpkin latte. Not too sweet and very yummy.</p>

<p>I’m taking a week long staycation between jobs and trying out different coffee shops in the Twin Cities. Yesterday, I went to <a href="http://www.caffettocafe.com/">Caffetto</a>.</p>
<p>Today, I’ve gone the other direction into Saint Paul to check out <a href="https://cafeastoria-stpaul.com/">Cafe Astoria</a>. They’ve got an extensive cafe menu and these beautiful rainbow lattes. I was tempted by the rainbow lattes, but decided to go with my usual drink, a cortado. What I got is certainly the <em>largest</em> cortado, I’ve ever seen. More like a small latte than the equal parts espresso and steamed milk that I was expecting. That said, it was very tasty - smooth, sweet, and perfectly warm.</p>

<p>If I’m in this neighborhood, I’ll certainly keep this spot in mind for coffee or lunch.</p>

  <title>NAWRS 2023</title>
  <dc:creator>Ben Jaques-Leslie</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>A few weeks ago, I had a great time at the <a href="https://nawrs.org/">NAWRS</a> 2023 Workshop in Salt Lake City, Utah. I’m more than a little biased because I am on the board of NAWRS and was the program co-chair. I had a lot to do with the the call for proposals, the selection of the presentation, and the organization. I was really happy with how it all turned out. People were having conversations about public assistance and research, how to respectively learn with participants, and how to put programs into practice.</p>
<p>I was part of three sessions. My first was organized my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ladonna-pavetti-2002ab44">Donna Pavetti</a>, giant of TANF research and fascinating person. She brought TANF researchers and policy people together from Minnesota, Utah, and Washington to talk about what we’ve been doing in outcome measurement for TANF. I talked a lot about the <a href="https://mn.gov/dhs/partners-and-providers/news-initiatives-reports-workgroups/economic-supports-cash-food/#11">Self-Support Index</a>, which was my primary work while I was at the Minnesota Department of Human Service. My Utah and Washington colleagues spoke about employment data and using <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/performance/performance-indicators">WIOA measures</a> for TANF. We had a great discussion with the attendees, talking about data availability, and collaborating with local partners.</p>
<p>My second session was organized my <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/about/richard-hendra">Rick Hendra</a> of MDRC to talk about the TANF Data Collaborative (<a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre/report/tanf-data-collaborative-pilot-profiles-collection-data-analytics-projects-state-county">ACF report</a>, <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/publication/tanf-data-collaborative-pilot-profiles">pilot profiles</a>, <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/opre/training-technical-assistance/improving-outcomes-families-through-better-use-data-tanf-data">video</a>, and <a href="https://www.mdrc.org/project/tanf-data-innovation#overview">MDRC page</a>). I was back with my colleagues from Utah. Rick gave an overview of the programs and Nycole (Utah) and I (Minnesota) talked about our pilots. We had a very engaged group and it was a pleasure to talk about our work exploring the relationship between participant racial identity and sanctions.</p>
<p>My last session was about Minnesota’s Emergency SNAP implementation. I did a lot of data work on the program and was very excited to go into the gory data details with people. You can find the slides for the presentation <a href="https://bpffjl.github.io/esnap-nawrs">here</a>.</p>
<p>We had a fun time in Utah. It’s rare for researchers in local governments to have a chance to get together to talk about their work. NAWRS was a great opportunity to share and learn from each other as always.</p>

<p>I love the vibe of <a href="http://www.caffettocafe.com/">Caffetto</a>. It’s not sleek or pristine. From my view I can see walls painted red and gold, covered with paintings by local artists. Cabinets are stuffed with piles or board games. A creepy bust sits by the window next to a pink lamp and two figurines. The music is old-sounding Americana, which probably isn’t to old.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I’m pretty underwhelmed by the coffee. My cappuccino is harsh and tastes of charred wood. The drink was prepared by holding back the foam in the steaming pitcher and pouring the hot milk into the espresso. Then the foamy was scooped on top. That’s never been my favorite way to make a cappuccino, but I was open to seeing what it tasted like. The first sip was all sweet foam. When i tried again and got some coffee, it tasted bitter and thick.</p>
